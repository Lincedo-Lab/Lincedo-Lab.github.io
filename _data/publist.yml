- title: "Summarising Historical Text in Modern Languages"
  image: xutan_eacl_2021.jpg
  description: We propose a hitherto unexplored and challenging task of historical text summarisation. To kickstart research in this field, we construct a high-quality summarisation corpus for historical German and Chinese, with modern German and Chinese summaries by experts. We also propose a model for historical text summarisation that does not require parallel supervision and provides a validated high-performing baseline for future studies.

- title: "Latent Space Factorisation and Manipulation via Matrix Subspace Projection"
  image: xiao_icml_2020.jpeg
  description: We tackle the problem disentangling the latent space of an autoencoder in order to separate labelled attribute information from other characteristic information. This then allows us to change selected attributes while preserving other information. Our method, matrix subspace projection, is much simpler than previous approaches to latent space factorisation, for example not requiring multiple discriminators or a careful weighting among their loss functions.

- title: "DGST: a Dual-Generator Network for Text Style Transfer"
  image: xiao_emnlp_2020.jpg
  description: We propose DGST, a novel and simple Dual-Generator network architecture for text Style Transfer. Our model employs two generators only, and  does not rely on any discriminators or parallel corpus for training. Both quantitative and qualitative experiments on the Yelp and IMDb datasets show that our model gives competitive performance compared to several strong baselines with more complicated architecture designs.

- title: "Improving Variational Autoencoder for Text Modelling with Timestep-Wise Regularisation"
  image: ruizhe_coling_2020.jpg
  description: In this paper, we propose a simple, generic architecture called Timestep-Wise Regularisation VAE (TWR-VAE), which can effectively avoid posterior collapse and can be applied to any RNN-based VAE models. The effectiveness and versatility of our model are demonstrated in different tasks, including language modelling and dialogue response generation.

- title: "Listener’s Social Identity Matters in Personalised Response Generation"
  image: guanyi_inlg_2020.png
  description: In the present paper, we use gender as a typical example of a social variable to investigate how the listener’s identity influences the language used in Chinese dialogues on social media. Also, we build personalised generators. The experiment results demonstrate that the listener’s identity indeed matters in the language use of responses and that the response generator can capture such differences in language use.

- title: "End-to-End Sequential Metaphor Identification Inspired by Linguistic Theories"
  image: rui_acl_2019.png
  description: End-to-end training with Deep Neural Networks (DNN) is a currently popular method for metaphor identification. However, standard sequence tagging models do not explicitly take advantage of linguistic theories of metaphor identification. We experiment with two DNN models which are inspired by two human metaphor identification procedures. By testing on three public datasets, we find that our models achieve state-of-the-art performance in end-to-end metaphor identification.

  image: ruizhe_conll_2019.png
  description: Recognising dialogue acts (DA) is important for many natural language processing tasks such as dialogue generation and intention recognition. In this paper, we propose a dual-attention hierarchical recurrent neural network for DA classification. Our model is partially inspired by the observation that conversational utterances are normally associated with both a DA and a topic, where the former captures the social act and the latter describes the subject matter.

  description: In this paper, we propose an unsupervised learning method that identifies and interprets metaphors at word-level without any preprocessing, outperforming strong baselines in the metaphor identification task. Our model extends to interpret the identified metaphors, paraphrasing them into their literal counterparts, so that they can be better translated by machines. We evaluated this with two popular translation systems for English to Chinese, showing that our model improved the systems significantly.
